# **DevNet Stack Lab**

My personal goal and hobby, implement a network infrastructure controller.
First steps, learn how to use the building blocks.  Below are tools I believe
will be a must.  As I progress on this exciting journey, the list will most
likely change because I don't know what I don't know.

The List

- Python
- Javascript
- HTML & CSS
- FastAPI / Flask
- Node.js
- React
- Docker
- SQLAlchemy
- Postgres
- rabbitmq
- scrapli / napalm / netmiko / ncclient
- scapy
- nmap
